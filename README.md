# The Algorithms
- Double DQN
- C51
- Policy Proximal Optimization
- Nureomodulation Net

# Training

- Each of the four algorithms were trained on random mario stages, they were then tested on Mario 1-1

# Basics

- The goal of reinforcment learning so for the agent to maximize the incomeing rewards from the enviroment.
- The Agent recieve an observation from the env, the state, the agent then acts based on the given observation. Then revieces a reward based on that action

# the Models

- each of the models have the same base layers of convulotions as shown above

# Requirements 
- Pytorch
- gym
- Mario gym
- numpy
- pil
